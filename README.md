# SHL Assessment Recommender

This project is a smart recommendation system that suggests SHL assessments based on a job description or user query using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

It includes:
- A **Flask backend** serving an assessment recommendation API.
- A lightweight **HTML UI** (served from Flask) for interacting with the recommender.
- A dataset of SHL assessments with metadata used for similarity matching.

## How it Works

1. A user enters a job description or desired skills.
2. The query is transformed using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
3. Cosine similarity is computed between the query and assessment descriptions.
4. The top-k most relevant SHL assessments are returned.
